Technical Description
---
Thor.NET is a cloud management application for Cloud Foundry (and Iron Foundry) enabled PaaS Environments. It runs natively on Windows 7, and by proxy will likely run fine on Windows 8 too. The architecture used is the MVVM (Model View ViewModel) with other appropriate abstractions and patterns used for data access, retrieval, and connecting to the Cloud Foundry & Iron Foundry enabled instances.
